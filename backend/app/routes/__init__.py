You’re just one layoff away from having an existential crisis on a Tuesday morning.And if you’re not learning or growing, you’re falling behind — simple as that.But you’re here, which means you’re different. You’re trying to study, grow, and manage your time better.Good choice. 👏🏻👏🏻🎢 What My Life Looks LikeI do a lot — maybe too much at times. And if you try to do multiple things, burnout is inevitable.For context, here is what I do:🧑‍💼 9–6 full-time job (which honestly eats half my energy)🧑‍💻 Freelance work (currently 2 clients)"

The only useful thing from my undergrad years was a really rigorous statistics course (which turned out to be super valuable)."
